## About the Projects

### Project 1: Performance Evaluation
To achieve a higher grade in the first project, we needed to utilize more features of PAPI (Performance API) and draw more comprehensive conclusions from the data collected. Additionally, the block implementation required optimization, possibly by refactoring some of the for-loops. The overall report also needed to be more technical and detailed in its explanations.

### Project 2: Distributed System
For the second project, improvements were necessary in several areas:
- **Password Encryption**: Encrypt passwords before storing them in the database.
- **Session Certificates**: Implement session certificates for enhanced security.
- **Reconnect Feature**: Significantly improve the reconnect feature to ensure it functions correctly.
- **Game Mechanics**: Since our game was played instantly, it didn't support reconnection. To address this, the game needed to be redesigned to allow players to re-enter ongoing sessions, which would involve changing the game mechanics to support non-instant play.

## Important Notice

**Warning**: Remember that copying these projects to make yours, might get you caught by a plagiarism test.
